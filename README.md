# Yelp elite project

When a Yelp user publishes enough detailed reviews of restaurants, he can acquire the status of an [elite user](https://www.yelp.com/elite/lawest). Elite users are often invited to events to try food and drinks for free since their feedback is highly sought after by restaurants, chefs and chains.

This project is exploring how one could become a Yelp elite user quickly by generating fake reviews produced by chatGPT and how Yelp could defend its plateform from such malicious users.
