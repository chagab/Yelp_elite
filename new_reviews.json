The chefs truly deserve commendation for the thoughtful presentation, making the dish a treat for both the palate and the eyes.\n\nHowever, I must mention that the price of this wagyu dish was a bit on the higher side for the portion size. While its exquisite taste was undeniable, I couldn't help but wish for a more generous serving. It's a minor drawback that didn't significantly diminish my overall satisfaction with the dining experience.\n\nIn conclusion, if you're a fan of wagyu and appreciate exceptional culinary craftsmanship, Lima Nikkei Westwood is definitely worth a visit. Though the dish may be considered pricey for the quantity, the quality alone makes it a worthwhile indulgence. The location above the new 99 Ranch market in Westwood adds to the charm of the experience, making it a delightful culinary adventure.",

    "review": "I had the pleasure of trying the seafood linguine at Umberto Trattoria, and it definitely did not disappoint! After spending a day at the Getty museum, the restaurant was a bit difficult to find, but it was well worth the search. While the overall food might not have wow-ed some diners, the seafood linguine was exceptional. As a big fan of fish and seafood, I was highly impressed with the freshness and quality of the ingredients in this dish. The service was fantastic, with friendly staff creating a great atmosphere. I particularly appreciated the quiet ambiance, which made the dining experience even more enjoyable. However, I have to note that my positive experience at the restaurant was marred by a disappointing incident. Despite having a reservation at 1pm, the restaurant was unexpectedly closed upon arrival, with other patrons also waiting outside for their reserved tables. It would have been helpful to have some sort of sign or communication indicating the closure. Despite this hiccup, the standout seafood linguine at Umberto Trattoria has left a lasting impression, and I would highly recommend it to any seafood lover.",
