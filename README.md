# Yelp elite project

When a Yelp user publishes enough detailed reviews of restaurants, he can acquire the status of an [elite user](https://www.yelp.com/elite/lawest). Elite users can get invited to events and try food and drinks for free because their feedback is valuable to the restaurant.

This is a project exploring how one could speedrun his way to become a Yelp elite member (free food? sure!) and how Yelp could defend its plateform from such malicious users.
